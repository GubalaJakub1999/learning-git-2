    <h1>Disturbed - Decadence</h1>
    <p>Say, yes they know that you fought yourself another time<br>
        Don't they know that you're full of pain already?<br> 
        Yes they know that you've hurt yourself another time<br> 
        Decadence isn't easy, is it?<br> 
        Yes they know that you've hurt yourself another time<br> 
        Don't they know that you're full of pain already?<br> 
        Yes they know that you've hurt yourself another time<br> 
        Decadence isn't easy, is it?<br>
    </p>
    <p>Then you slowly recall all your mind 
        Why, your soul's gone cold, and all hope has run dry 
        Dead inside 
        Never enough to forget that you're one of the lonely 
        Slowly recall all your mind
    </p>
